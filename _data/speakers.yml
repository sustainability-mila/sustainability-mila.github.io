  title: "Maritime Transport Environmental Impact: ML Approaches for Emissions Reduction and Marine Mammal Protection in the St. Lawrence Seaway"
  abstract: "Maritime transport's environmental impact presents unprecedented challenges for marine ecosystems through emissions and acoustic pollution, yet ML in marine sciences remains underrepresented in environmental monitoring efforts. This presentation addresses this gap by demonstrating how ML revolutionizes our understanding of shipping's ecological footprint, particularly regarding emissions and noise pollution reduction and their impact on marine mammals in the St. Lawrence Seaway. Among various maritime transport emissions reduction strategies, operational optimization through just-in-time policies represents a short-term and low-cost solution. This approach enables vessels to adjust their speed, reducing unnecessary waiting, fuel consumption and noise pollution. We will present an intelligent maritime transport system based on ML models to predict accurate, real-time ETAs and speed as soon as any vessel enters Canadian waters, enabling comprehensive monitoring of maritime operations and the estimation of vessels' emissions and noise in the St. Lawrence River. This is a complex maritime corridor, where automated acoustic monitoring addresses critical challenges in marine mammal conservation. Marine mammals rely on sound for communication, navigation, and foraging, while increasing shipping activity introduces acoustic pollution that interferes with essential biological functions and generates physiological stress. In this presentation, we will also discuss an uncertainty-quantified imputation approach and an attention-guided denoising framework to transform raw hydrophone data from underwater sensor networks into reliable species detection and behavioral analysis tools. These approaches effectively handle noisy conditions, overlapping frequency signals, and incomplete sensor data while providing principled uncertainty quantification."

  title: "L’Insectarium de Montréal : une vitrine d’innovation pour se connecter avec les insectes autrement"
  abstract: "L’Insectarium de Montréal se distingue par ses approches audacieuses et novatrices pour faire découvrir les insectes sous toutes leurs facettes autant pour le volet recherche qu’éducatif du musée. En repensant l’expérience muséale, l’Insectarium invite le public à dépasser les préjugés et à développer une véritable entomophilie — un amour et une curiosité pour le monde des insectes en entrant en connexion avec eux, notamment par le biais de l’IA. Au cœur de cette démarche se trouve l’étude participative de la biodiversité. À même le parcours muséal, les visiteurs ont la possibilité de photographier les insectes qu’ils observent dans le grand vivarium et les identifier grâce à un algorithme développé en collaboration avec le MILA. Les visiteurs redevenus citoyens sont par la suite invités à contribuer activement à la documentation des espèces locales, notamment par l’observation, la photographie et le partage de données à travers de nombreux projets de science participative. Ces initiatives favorisent une compréhension plus fine des écosystèmes et renforcent le lien des participants avec la nature, la science et la société. L’Insectarium intègre également des technologies de pointe dans le musée et en recherche, comme la détection et le monitoring automatisé assisté par intelligence artificielle de la biodiversité entomologique. Ces outils permettent de suivre en temps réel les populations d’insectes, d’analyser leurs comportements et de détecter des changements environnementaux subtils. Cette approche ouvre la voie à des collaborations scientifiques à grande échelle et se décline dans plusieurs projets collaboratifs du musée du grand nord Québécois jusqu’à l’Amérique Centrale. "

  title: "A Degrowth Perspective on Artificial Intelligence"
  abstract: "The degrowth literature has so far largely left unshaped its vision on the role of technology. In the meantime, governments all over the world are accelerating the development and application of high-end digital technologies such as Artificial Intelligence, notably because of their potential to enhance economic growth. Considering that these developments risk locking-in our society in a set of technological infrastructures that are environmentally destructive and growth-pursuing, there is an urgent need to carry out a critical analysis of these technologies from a degrowth perspective. This presentation will summarise some of the main questions and findings of my master’s thesis “A Degrowth Perspective on Artificial Intelligence - Analysing the Appropriateness of Machine Learning to a Degrowth Context”. It will notably talk about the links between Artificial Intelligence and economic growth as well the concept of convivial technologies. This session will conclude by opening up a discussion on how we could imagine digital technologies differently - in line with people and the planet."

  abstract: "The electric power field is undergoing major changes due to the desired energy transition. The challenges for utilities include producing more energy, integrating intermittent renewable sources, adapting to changes in consumer behavior, and providing a reliable service through more frequent extreme weather events. At Hydro-Québec's Research Center, we explore how machine learning can be used to better model, optimize, and robustify the power system, for production, transport, and distribution in this context. In this presentation, Vincent will present three projects he has been working on in this field: Active learning-based optimization of hydroelectric turbine startup to minimize fatigue (submitted to Renewable Energy) Safe reinforcement learning for remote microgrid optimization with industrial constraints (presented at NeurIPS CCAI, together with Hadi Nekoei from Mila) Foundation Models for the electric power grid (published in Joule - a long term open source project)"

  title: "Climate Instability and the Future of AI: Force Majeure, Open Source Hardware, and a Decomputerisation Movement"
  abstract: "The semiconductor industry has a global market cap of 6.7 trillion dollars. The software industry has a market cap of 11.9 trillion. I argue that the compounding and global-in-scale political, economic, and social implications of runaway climate instability have not yet been priced into this cumulative ±18 trillion dollar valuation, nor accounted for in popular commentary about an inevitable ‘AI future.’ Rather than omit fires, floods, droughts, famines, and their resulting human and ecological implications from speculations about AI’s future, I attempt to account for their impact on the incentives driving technical research in the coming decades. With reference to history, I outline three speculative trends: A) increased overlap between the political economy of the tech and energy sectors, opening room for a decomputerisation movement, B) a push towards AI-based edge computing and C) the emergence of open source hardware towards the semiconductor industry’s ‘Raspberry Pi’ moment."
