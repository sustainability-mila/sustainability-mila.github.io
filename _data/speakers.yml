  position: Full Professor in the Department of Biological Sciences
  bio: "Étienne is a member of the Institut de recherche en biologie végétale, and holds the Canada Research Chair in Plant Functional Biodiversity. He also heads the Canadian Airborne Biodiversity Observatory (CABO). His current research focuses on the development of new approches for vegetation monitoring (plant biodiversity and carbon) based on high-resolution remote sensing using drones and computer vision. He is particularly interested in applications of this technology that can help mitigate biodiversity loss and climate change, and that can have rapid and widespread impact."

  position: Assistant Professor in the Department of Biology
  bio: "Laura aimsto understand how and why biodiversity is distributed across the landscapes. She uses predictive modelling that draws from a range of subfields (macro-ecology, community ecology, biogeography and phylo-geography) and data (traits, phylogenies, experts) and she's also interested in translating biodiversity science to inform conservation planning."
